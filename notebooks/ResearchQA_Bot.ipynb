The paper discusses a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interweaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, termed Hyena modules, for use in convolutional language models. The purpose of the paper is to solve the limitations of attention operators in sequence length and matching transformer quality while requiring less training compute. \n",

They propose 16 analyses that allow them to evaluate different characteristics of the corpus. Applying this analysis to 10 different corpora used to train popular language models uncover several surprising and previously undocumented findings. These include high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and contamination of benchmark datasets. The paper emphasizes the need for such analysis tools and evaluation of text corpora to enable researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions about the suitability of specific corpora for their applications.\n",

We show all the plots in Figure 11. Note that: 1. The location of each data point in the charts ignores the model size and only reflects its inference FLOP per token. For example, a 1.4B model with CFG (doubled inference FLOP) will show up near a 2.8B model without CFG if they perform closely, despite the fact that such 1.4B model is more useful in practice due to the saving on training and VRAM. 2. The data points in the charts only reflect the inference cost and ignoring the training cost. For example, when a 1.4B model gets boosted to the accuracy of a 2.8B model by using CFG, the inference costs are similar but to train a 1.4B model takes less compute. For Lambada and SciQ, CFG is a clear winner which improves the whole compute-accuracy curve while for WinoGrande, CFG impacts negatively. The rest are mixed. This entails that for the same inference cost, CFG can emulate a model that has twice the parameter count. This drastically reduces the VRAM usage needed to run the models which is the current bottleneck, and reduces the training cost. To further justify this, Table 11 is a breakdown of the ANCOVA p-values for each chart between the regression line of the CFG group (in red) and the one of the vanilla group (in blue). We choose the p-value cutoff at 0.01 according to [67], and higher than 0.01 means an insignificant difference between the regression lines of the two groups. C.3 HumanEval benchmark In Section 3.3.1, we explain our experiments on CodeGen-350M-mono, CodeGen-2B-mono and CodeGen-6B-mono and show their performances in the HumanEval benchmark with various CFG for temperature 0.2 in Table 2. The full results for temperature = 0.2, 0.6, 0.8 are shown below in Table 5, 6 and 7). We also put the pass@k-to- curves of different temperatures together to show how the temperatures affect the impact of CFG when the model size and k are fixed in Figure 12, 13 and 14. 8FLOP: floating point operations\",\n          \"Figure D.2: Hyena matrices from a Hyena small (same model used for SuperGLUE downstream evaluations). \\\"We use the test string \\\"Attention is all you need.

The Wanda method also compares weights on a per-output basis, rather than across the entire layer.

It is used to evaluate the magnitude of features in the input activations. This information is then used to calculate the importance score for each weight, which is defined as the product of the weight\\'s magnitude and the corresponding input feature norm. By using this metric, Wanda can identify and preserve weights that are connected to large magnitude features, even if those weights themselves have low magnitudes.

The filter is a 2-D matrix with values ranging from white to red, where red represents a high value and white represents a low value. The image shows that the filter at initialization is smooth, but after training, it becomes more complex and less smooth. This is because the model learns to focus on specific frequencies in the data, which results in a filter with a more complex structure. The figure shows that the choice of positional encoding features has an impact on the filter initialization and training performances. Specifically, it shows how the choice of K induces a bias in the modeled frequencies at initialization. The filters resemble low-pass filters with a cut-off frequency of approximately 2K+1, which is strongly related to the smoothness of the filter. The figure also shows that we can achieve good initializations by increasing K, which results in larger FFNs (its input dimension is 2K+1, i.e. the number of positional encoding features) which come with a higher parameter count. A more efficient solution is to increase the frequency of the sinusoidal activation. The figure shows how with K=8 we can cover the full spectrum simply by setting a=10. This indicates that the Hyena long convolution filters are able to learn a collection of lower-order filters with a similar structure, which can be exploited to further speed up inference after training. The figure further supports the idea that the performance improvements obtained via Hyena filters could be due to easier optimization in the space of convolutional filters.</img><img file_path=(2302.10866.pdf_page_30_image_2.png)>The image shows a visualization of Hyena long convolution filters at initialization and after training to completion on The Pile.

The image shows the filters for different values of K, which correspond to different frequencies of the sinusoidal activation. The filters are initialized to be non-smooth, which has been shown to result in better training dynamics. The number of features of the positional encoding has an impact on the filter initialization and training performances. Specifically, we show how K leads to a preconditioning of the spectrum of the filter at initialization. The image shows that the choice of K induces a bias in the modeled frequencies at initialization. Specifically, the filters resemble low-pass filters with a cut-off frequency of approximately 2K+1. This cut-off frequency is strongly related to the smoothness of the filter; as previously mentioned, we empirically observe better training dynamics of filters initialized to be non-smooth, i.e., with a rich high-frequency content. While we can achieve good initializations by increasing K, this results in larger FFNs (its input dimension is 2K+1, i.e., the number of positional encoding features) which come with a higher parameter count.

The heatmap shows a concentration of orange color in a specific region, indicating a higher value or activity in that area. The filters are initialized with a truncated complex exponential basis, and the number of features in the positional encoding affects the filter initialization and training performance. Increasing the number of features leads to a preconditioning of the filter's spectrum at initialization, resulting in a bias towards lower frequencies. This can be seen in the image, where the filter resembles a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of approximately 2K+1. The smoothness of the filter is related to its cut-off frequency, with smoother filters having a lower cut-off frequency. While increasing the number of features can improve initialization, it also leads to larger FFNs and a higher parameter count. A more efficient solution is to increase the frequency of the sinusoidal activation, which can cover the full spectrum with fewer features. The image suggests that Hyena filters benefit from non-smooth initializations, which have a rich high-frequency content.

Further, the image shows that initialization schemes that regularize filters towards typical filters learned at convergence decrease performance. These observations are in line with performance gaps between convolution parameterization schemes discussed in the main text and Appendix A.1. In particular, the performance improvements obtained via Hyena filters could be due to easier optimization in the space of convolutional filters.

The statements are ranked from best to worst, with the best statement being that a research group in the United States has found that parrots can imitate human speech with ease, and some of them can even do so in the same way as humans. The worst statement is that current research suggests that parrots see and hear things in a different way than humans do. While humans see a rainbow of colors, parrots only see shades of red and green. Parrots can also see ultraviolet light, which is invisible to humans. Many birds have this ability to see ultraviolet light, an ability that is not unique to parrots.</img>'],\n",

In this paper, the authors propose a simple and efficient EM algorithm to solve weighted low-rank approximation problems, which differ from their unweighted counterparts as they do not have a closed-form solution. The paper also analyzes the nature of locally optimal solutions and extends the formulation to non-Gaussian noise models such as logistic models. The authors also demonstrate the practical utility of accommodating the weights in reconstructing the underlying low-rank representation in a collaborative filtering task.\n",
